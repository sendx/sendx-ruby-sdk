#SendX REST API

## SendX REST API Documentation  ## üöÄ Introduction  The SendX API is organized around REST principles. Our API has predictable resource-oriented URLs, accepts JSON-encoded request bodies, returns JSON-encoded responses, and uses standard HTTP response codes, authentication, and verbs.  **Key Features:** - üîí **Security**: Team-based authentication with optional member-level access - üéØ **Resource-Oriented**: RESTful design with clear resource boundaries - üìä **Rich Data Models**: Three-layer model system (Input/Output/Internal) - üîó **Relationships**: Automatic prefix handling for resource relationships - üìà **Scalable**: Built for high-volume email marketing operations  ## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview  SendX uses a three-layer model architecture:  1. **Input Models** (`RestE*`): For API requests 2. **Output Models** (`RestR*`): For API responses with prefixed IDs 3. **Internal Models**: Core business logic (not exposed in API)  ## üîê Security & Authentication  SendX uses API key authentication:  ### Team API Key ```http X-Team-ApiKey: YOUR_TEAM_API_KEY ``` - **Required for all requests** - Team-level access to resources - Available in SendX Settings ‚Üí Team API Key  ## üÜî Encrypted ID System  SendX uses encrypted IDs for security and better developer experience:  - **Internal IDs**: Sequential integers (not exposed) - **Encrypted IDs**: 22-character alphanumeric strings - **Prefixed IDs**: Resource-type prefixes in API responses (`contact_<22-char-id>`)  ### ID Format  **All resource IDs follow this pattern:** ``` <resource_prefix>_<22_character_alphanumeric_string> ```  **Example:** ```json {   \"id\": \"contact_BnKjkbBBS500CoBCP0oChQ\",   \"lists\": [\"list_OcuxJHdiAvujmwQVJfd3ss\", \"list_0tOFLp5RgV7s3LNiHrjGYs\"],   \"tags\": [\"tag_UhsDkjL772Qbj5lWtT62VK\", \"tag_fL7t9lsnZ9swvx2HrtQ9wM\"] } ```  ## üìö Resource Prefixes  | Resource | Prefix | Example | |----------|--------|---------| | Contact | `contact_` | `contact_BnKjkbBBS500CoBCP0oChQ` | | Campaign | `campaign_` | `campaign_LUE9BTxmksSmqHWbh96zsn` | | List | `list_` | `list_OcuxJHdiAvujmwQVJfd3ss` | | Tag | `tag_` | `tag_UhsDkjL772Qbj5lWtT62VK` | | Sender | `sender_` | `sender_4vK3WFhMgvOwUNyaL4QxCD` | | Template | `template_` | `template_f3lJvTEhSjKGVb5Lwc5SWS` | | Custom Field | `field_` | `field_MnuqBAG2NPLm7PZMWbjQxt` | | Webhook | `webhook_` | `webhook_9l154iiXlZoPo7vngmamee` | | Post | `post_` | `post_XyZ123aBc456DeF789GhI` | | Post Category | `post_category_` | `post_category_YzS1wOU20yw87UUHKxMzwn` | | Post Tag | `post_tag_` | `post_tag_123XyZ456AbC` | | Member | `member_` | `member_JkL012MnO345PqR678` |  ## üéØ Best Practices  ### Error Handling - **Always check status codes**: 2xx = success, 4xx = client error, 5xx = server error - **Read error messages**: Descriptive messages help debug issues - **Handle rate limits**: Respect API rate limits for optimal performance  ### Data Validation - **Email format**: Must be valid email addresses - **Required fields**: Check documentation for mandatory fields - **Field lengths**: Respect maximum length constraints  ### Performance - **Pagination**: Use offset/limit for large datasets - **Batch operations**: Process multiple items when supported - **Caching**: Cache responses when appropriate  ## üõ†Ô∏è SDKs & Integration  Official SDKs available for: - [Golang](https://github.com/sendx/sendx-go-sdk) - [Python](https://github.com/sendx/sendx-python-sdk) - [Ruby](https://github.com/sendx/sendx-ruby-sdk) - [Java](https://github.com/sendx/sendx-java-sdk) - [PHP](https://github.com/sendx/sendx-php-sdk) - [JavaScript](https://github.com/sendx/sendx-javascript-sdk)  ## üìû Support  Need help?

# load the gem
require 'sendx-ruby-sdk'

# The following  was generated by the `rspec --init` command. Conventionally, all
# specs live under a `spec` directory, which RSpec adds to the `$LOAD_PATH`.
# The generated `.rspec` file contains `--require spec_helper` which will cause
# this file to always be loaded, without a need to explicitly require it in any
# files.
#
# Given that it is always loaded, you are encouraged to keep this file as
# light-weight as possible. Requiring heavyweight dependencies from this file
# will add to the boot time of your test suite on EVERY test run, even for an
# individual file that may not need all of that loaded. Instead, consider making
# a separate helper file that requires the additional dependencies and performs
# the additional setup, and require it from the spec files that actually need
# it.
#
# The `.rspec` file also contains a few flags that are not defaults but that
# users commonly want.
#
# See http://rubydoc.info/gems/rspec-core/RSpec/Core/Configuration

  # assertions if you prefer.
  config.expect_with :rspec do |expectations|
    # This option will default to `true` in RSpec 4. It makes the `description`
    # and `failure_message` of custom matchers include text for helper methods
    # defined using `chain`, e.g.:
    #     be_bigger_than(2).and_smaller_than(4).description
    #     # => "be bigger than 2 and smaller than 4"
    # ...rather than:
    #     # => "be bigger than 2"

  # rspec-mocks config goes here. You can use an alternate test double
  # library (such as bogus or mocha) by changing the `mock_with` option here.
  config.mock_with :rspec do |mocks|
